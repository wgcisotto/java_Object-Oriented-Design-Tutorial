**last check: 22.01.2018**

As you probably know, object-oriented programming concepts are very important. Without having an idea about OOPS concepts,

In this project, I would like to explain 10 important OOPS concepts with examples.

The following diagram shows a list of OOPS concepts in Java that we will be taking a look at in this project.
