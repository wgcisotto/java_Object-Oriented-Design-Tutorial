### Encapsulation

> Intent / Definition

Encapsulation refers to combining data and associated functions as a single unit.
In OOP, data and functions operating on that data are combined together to form a single unit, which is referred to as a class.

> Implementation

 The process of binding or wrapping the data and the codes that operate on the data into a single entity. This keeps the data safe from outside interface and misuse. One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper.
For example - if a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.

> Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation


Abstraction and Encapsulation in Java are two important Object-oriented programming concept and they are completely different to each other.

- Encapsulation is a process of binding or wrapping the data and the codes that operate on the data into a single entity. This keeps the data safe from outside interface and misuse.
- Abstraction is the concept of hiding irrelevant details. In other words, make the complex system simple by hiding the unnecessary detail from the user.
- Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using private, package-private and protected access modifiers.
- Abstraction solves the problem in the design level. Whereas Encapsulation solves the problem in the implementation level.


Encapsulation : Information hiding.

Abstraction : Implementation hiding.
